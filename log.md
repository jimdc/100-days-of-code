# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: March 26, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Scraped `textContent` with `document.querySelector()` for gender-reveal.

**Thoughts:** Not sure how much I should pay attention to Javascript's unique way of scoping, in light of browser optimizations. Still using JSLint but more skeptical of it. Finding out where the page "reloads" in React is tricky.
