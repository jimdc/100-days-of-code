# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: March 26, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Scraped `textContent` with `document.querySelector()` for gender-reveal.

**Thoughts:** Not sure how much I should pay attention to Javascript's unique way of scoping, in light of browser optimizations. Still using JSLint but more skeptical of it. Finding out where the page "reloads" in React is tricky.

### Day 1: March 27, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Made gender-reveal more modular, added gendered pronouns (which work in theory).

**Thoughts:** No way this extension can work on every exercise, and on especially some languages like German, without some NLP processing of how words relate to each other in the context of a sentence.
