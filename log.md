# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: March 26, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Scraped `textContent` with `document.querySelector()` for gender-reveal.

**Thoughts:** Not sure how much I should pay attention to Javascript's unique way of scoping, in light of browser optimizations. Still using JSLint but more skeptical of it. Finding out where the page "reloads" in React is tricky.

### Day 1: March 27, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Made gender-reveal more modular, added gendered pronouns (which work in theory).

**Thoughts:** No way this extension can work on every exercise, and on especially some languages like German, without some NLP processing of how words relate to each other in the context of a sentence.

### Day 2: March 28, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Gendered-pronouns work in practice, scaffolding for multiple-choice.

**Thoughts:** I wonder if I should have dummy HTML pages, serving dynamic content in similar classes to test this script? Because I couldn't *even* with this external service to serve me a certain type of question.

### Day 3: March 29, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Walked through "[create a quiz with react](https://mitchgavan.com/react-quiz/)". 

**Thoughts:** The concept of props and state is still shaky to me, but I loved seeing how the modularity made it easy to refactor.
